        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The section element are semantic elements that define a section
             in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
          <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>The a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The img element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image</li>
          <li>The link element creates the connection to the external file.
            The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.
            The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. The href attribute is using a relative path. This means the location is derived from the current location (in this case, index.html). To locate the style sheet from the current location, we must look in the assets folder, hence assets/style.css.</li>

          <li>The period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
